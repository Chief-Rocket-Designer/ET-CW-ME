#		IMPORTANT STUFF FOR NEW NATIONAL FOCUSES
#
#		1st:
#			make sure you have used this trigger:
#				country = {
#					factor = 0
#					
#					modifier = {
#						add = 200
#						tag = COUNTRY_TAG
#					}
#				}
#			it is very important that you set the "add = INT" to larger or equals than 200, otherwise, this focus will be overriden by the GENERIC_FOCUS
#		
#
#
#
#			If you looked in the generic_focus.txt file and if you have any clue what that code means, you maybe got that I lied: you can use every "add = INT" which is larger than 200, but I still recommend 200
#
#
#
#		2nd:
#			PLEASE, use "relative_position_id = FOCUS_ID", if you use that, you can edit the coordinates easier: their reference is the "FOCUS_ID", so you just have to define the difference between the "FOCUS_ID" and your "CURRENT_FOCUS"
#
#		3rd:
#			If you use that above, THEN do not use the "relative_position_id = FOCUS_ID" to reference at a focus WHICH is coded LATER than your current focus.
#			ie:
#				FOCUS_A = {
#					relative_position_id = FOCUS_B
#				}
#
#				FOCUS_B = {
#					...
#				}
#			---> DONT DO THAT, in that case FOCUS_B has to be scripted before FOCUS_A
