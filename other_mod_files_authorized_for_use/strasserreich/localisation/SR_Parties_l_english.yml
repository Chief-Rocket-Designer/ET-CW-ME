strasserism_subtype_desc:0 "Strasserism can be considered 'Socialist Nationalism' in relation to National Socialism. It represents the ideology of those who were on the left-wing of the NSDAP before Hitler's death. Named after two of its most prominent members, Gregor and Otto Strasser, Strasserism partially takes inspiration from but also rejects parts of communist ideology. Due to the chaos ensuing the death of Hitler, Strasserism has been grown in popularity, cumulating in the victory in the 1935 Elections."

#Events (linking with National Focuses)#
strasser.1.t:0 "Strasserreich"
strasser.1.d:0 "Strasserreich is a narrow yet deep mod by Teutonician Germanicus Danziger, that changes two factors of Hitler’s life which results of Gregor Strasser to become President and Otto Strasser as Chancellor. It all starts in June 1934, where Himmler or Goring (Not known IRL) had decided not to kill political opponents in the NSDAP like Strasser, but alternatively concentrated more heavily on the elimination of the Sturmabteilung (SA) officials that would have been close to Rohm, this includes branches of the Freikorps which on July 1934 a man named Beppo Römer an ex-Freikorp member takes vengeance via assassinating Hitler when leaving the Reichstag, A month later, on August 1934, Paul von Hindenburg dies from lung cancer without filling the seat for chancellor. These unexpected events spark an economic depression and overall depression for the German people as a result. This again resulted to even further frustration in the minds of the German people who were now going more and more in favour of extreme politics like communism, fascism and now strasserism. Strasserism is a more radical worker based on the NSDAP (which expanded the Black Front after Hitler’s death), it is the ideological belief that is partially communist and fascist yet is against or neutral with both. A easy way of understanding is that if Hitler was a National Socialist, then Strasser is a Socialist National. Such a radical ideology was pivotal for the German people, as it was a direct answer to the issue Germany is facing. Now it is time to decide the best course of action to try to achieve complete Strasserism or die trying."
strasser.1.a:0 "Thank you for that wall of text."
strasser.2.t:0 "The Hammer or The Sword?"
strasser.2.d:0 "From the moment of the creation of the German state in the 19th century, Germany has struggled to put itelf on what her priorities are, and this implies to this case. The new Strasserist Volksreich government needs to set itself it's first piority, will it help infastructure and it's economy and overall helping financially the people of her nation, or should it be in the defense and supply assurance and protection to her subjects. Since the rise of Mussolini and the recent assassination of Hitler, Germany must protect itself from external and internal threats, otherwise it will cease to exit."
strasser.2.a:0 "The Hammer! We must provide for our people!"
strasser.2.b:0 "The Sword! We must protect our people!"
strasser.3.t:0 "The Hammer"
strasser.3.d:0 "We have decided to supply help for our people, which should have naturally accoured to us... How could we have provided the army with food if our people rejected and undersupply due to their farms slowly decaying away, yet there is still an issue on how to solve the question of the economic issues, one way from Gregor's perspective would be to tackle poverty and build up the middle class who were affected the most out of all the other classes, the other way from Otto's perspective would be to make the government take apon the economic situation and manually redistribute the private capital system by nationalizing the German economy which will greatly speed up the government's size of role and control with the economy."
strasser.3.a:0 "Gregor's Hammer is the way to go."
strasser.3.b:0 "Otto's Hammer is the right choice."
strasser.4.t:0 "The Sword"
strasser.4.d:0 "We have decided to ensure safetly for our people, which should have naturally accoured to us... How could we be truely safe if we could have been attacked by anyone from anywhere, of course we need a stronger army, to even reinforce our national stability! Yet there is still an issue on how to solve the question of the army, one way from Gregor's perspective would be to reinforce the army with officers and rapid mobilization so that organisation of the troops would be of high standard, the other way from Otto's perspective would be strength itself, by teaching the troops incase there would be a war on how to attack a certain region. We need to decide now to make sure that the army has a certain doctrine."
strasser.4.a:0 "Gregor's Sword is the way to go."
strasser.4.b:0 "Otto's Sword is the right choice."
strasser.5.t:0 "Strassers' Pamphlet"
strasser.5.d:0 "Strassers' Pamphlet is what Germany's economic agricultural plan going to be like. There are two possible answers, we can either start from scratch making sure that we have factors of production in agriculture, or, we can nationalise the agricultural industry, as to create true Autarky we first need to make sure that the foodstuffs are being supplied to the people of Germany."
strasser.5.a:0 "Start from scratch."
strasser.5.b:0 "Nationalise it."
strasser.6.t:0 "Strassers' Manifesto"
strasser.6.d:0 "Strassers' Manifesto will provide the answers to what Strasserism is all about, it will also help us get allies internally, as both communism and the old party of the NSDAP have opposed us in our foreign policy, economic policy, and military policy. We need to outline what we want to achieve. We can do this by either 1. Have emphasis on the workers' rights and the nationalisation of private businesses, eninstating that the capitalist policy is a threat to mankind's thinking, or 2. Have emphasis on the pride of the German people and the blood that goes through our vains, ensuring that we need to achieve pride and honour so that we can, yet again, go back on the world stage and show dominance over the European theatre."
strasser.6.a:0 "The unity of the workers is what we need."
strasser.6.b:0 "The pride of the Germans is what we need."
strasser.7.t:0 "Strassers' Letter"
strasser.7.d:0 "Strassers' Letter is going give discipline and support of the German people to the army itself. We need to make sure that there will be no revolution in the Volksreich or an another assassination attempt on the chancellor or perhabs the president this time. This will also help us prevent any strikes that would harm not only the economy but also the heart of the German Volksreich."
strasser.7.a:0 "'Strasser Mit Uns.'"
strasser.8.t:0 "Hitler's Assassination"
strasser.8.d:0 "On the 28th of July 1935, Adolf Hitler was assassinated by a man called Beppo Rohmen; he was a ex-freikorp who wanted revenge for the Night of the Long Knives as there was greater emphasis on Freikorp officers as they were suspected of starting a coup on Hitler's and Von Hindenburg's government. This assassination led a shockwave to all of Germany, especially how Hitler was a common household name, and was admired and seen as the hero of Germany's future. If anything couldn't be worse; one month after the assassination, Paul Von Hindenburg dies from natural causes, this aswell causes mass sadness apon the German people. Effects are still seen to this day, but over the past years it has been lowered down, especially how most people now prefer the Strasser brothers than Hitler."
strasser.8.a:0 "I wonder what would've Hitler done..."
strasser.9.t:0 "Volksreich Flag Selection"
strasser.9.d:0 "Ever since the Strassers' election win, the national flag of Germany has officially stayed the traditional Red-White-Black colour scheme, but it can be barely seen nowdays and 99% of the time, the common Black Front flag has been shown on most building and rallies and has been more associated with the state. Though there are talks of changing the official flag."

strasser.11.b:0 "We will threaten war!"
strasser.12.t:0 "The Spanish Civil War"
strasser.12.d:0 "At times like these, Germany must put herself on the world stage, the first step would be by picking a side of the two blocs, the Communists; that would secure the eastern front, or the Fascists that would secure the southern front. Recently, there has been a civil war in Spain that has the most apparant difference of the ideologies. Germany can choose the Nationalists, that is led by a fascist dictator called Francisco Franco, or choose the Republicians led by Manuel Azaña. There is actually a third option. We can guarrantee the Strasserist party of the Catalonian region that it would break away from Republician Spain in an effort to gain independence."
strasser.12.a:0 "The Nationalists"
strasser.12.b:0 "The Republicians"
strasser.12.c:0 "The Catalonians"
strasser.13.t:0 "Catalonian Uprising"
strasser.13.d:0 "Catalonia demands independence after seeing the international support of Germany. The Catalonians want to achieve a new ideology called "Strasserism" which includes some characteristics of Fascism, and Communism. Therefore they are an enemy of both us and the Nationalists."

strasser.15.d:0 "The French army has resisted to the remiliterisation of the Rhineland by taking over the region of Saarland, but it seems they have stoped after the city of Trier. It seems that they are waiting on what we would do next... Our two choises is either continue to meet into the city of Trier where the French army will sure to ingage us or we can just stop outside to Trier and recognise Saarland under French occupation."

strasser.16.a:0 "Dear lord..."
strasser.17.t:0 "Danger of a Austrian Civil War"
strasser.17.d:0 "Ever since the German election and with Strasserism becoming influencial throughout Europe, Austrians now seek unification with Germany, but the only problem is that The United Kingdom and France would never let this happen. Suddenly a letter came in from the Grey Front party saying that we could use an excuse that we are sending peacekeepers into the country to avoid bloodshed. When we send the army, we will make a referendum for the general leading the army to become Chancellor creating a Austrian Volksreichprotektorate, and the Austrian people would of course love to do such a thing, and the people who don't will be intimidated by the Volksreich soldiers present at the voting booths, perfect!"
strasser.17.a:0 "Perfect, send in the troops!"
strasser.18.t:0 "Anschluss of Austria"
strasser.18.d:0 "With the Volksreich troops present in Austria, and all of the administrative cabinates like the chancellorship being under our influence we can yet again start a referendum starting a full unification of both German Volksreich and the Austrian Volksreichprotektorate. The French and English will try to avoid another world war so, without a doubt they would recognise this referendum."
strasser.18.a:0 "Heil Strasser!"
strasser.19.t:0 "Declaration of War to Austria"
strasser.19.d:0 "As there is a chancellor who is against our views of strasserism, and that there isn't any anschluss support for Austrians, we see that without consideration that the best alternative would be the use of an army. Hopefully Italy will be alright with their north border being exposed to the great Volksreich of Germany!"
strasser.19.a:0 "Heil Strasser!"
strasser.20.t:0 "Eupen Putsch by von Lüttwitz"
strasser.20.d:0 "An general of the First World War and a influential Freikorp leader Walther von Lüttwitz rises up in the city of Eupen in Belgium. It seems that if Belgium can't take over the city soon, it can be annexed by the great German Volksreich!"

strasser.23.b:0 "Who cares about those sheeplands?!"
strasser.24.t:0 "Luxembourg Question"
strasser.24.d:0 "Luxembourg is sometimes rarely, but sometimes described Germany, mainly due to it's affiliation with the Holy Roman Empire from the 8th century to the 19th century. There is a large German population and Luxembourgish customs and traditions are very simular to ones of us. We can get Luxembourg to be recognised internationally as German core."
strasser.24.b:0 "Off ahead, we must make the Lebensraum bigger later on!"
strasser.24.a:0 "Who cares about that castle?!"
strasser.25.t:0 "Slovenian Question"

strasser.25.a:0 "Großdeutschland Volksreich will be a reality one day."
strasser.26.t:0 "Sudentenland Question"
strasser.26.d:0 "The Sudentenland region has probably the most affiliation with Germany, without actually ever being in Germany apart from the Holy Roman Empire. There are over 3 million German speakers, most of which desperately want to join the German Volksreich, we must do something about it."

strasser.38.d:0 "There has been a matter about the class conflict in the party and Otto Strasser pointed out that the best way to no longer widen the classes is to let the state do it's work, but the majority of the party have said that it would be better to just liquidate the rich industrial owners that have seen numerous times of conviction for corruption."

Since Hitler's death the Black Front has been divided apon the issue of how to celebrate of destroy the ideas of Hitler being the savior of Germany that died because of him. This trial would result if we release him free as Hitler was clearly a mass murderer during the Night of the Long Knives or we execute him for assassinating the Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler which resulted in chaos with finances and politics."
