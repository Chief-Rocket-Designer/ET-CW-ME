##### ATTENTION: in some cases you have to change the "buildings", this can be found in "map/builings", there YOU HAVE TO CHANGE the STATE_ID which has been changed by creating a new state, which uses these GFX, for example the naval base in NYC,
#####
##### ALSO you have to add this new state into "supplyareas"
##### for this, just look in the "map"-folder
