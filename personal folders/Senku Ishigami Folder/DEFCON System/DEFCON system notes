Note. Each country has their own defcon it is not a global defcon level.


Guide ---> effect_div will only happen if there are > than 1 division per 100,000 population
		   effect_stand = is a standard effect that will always happen to that nation regardless of division number

DEFCON system

Note if a wargoal is being justfied against "your" nation or a faction member you automatically go to defcon 2. If it is being justified against a country that "you"
guranteed it will automatically go to defcon 3. If you are already at defcon 3 you go to defcon 2.
